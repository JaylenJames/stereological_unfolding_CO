# stereological_unfolding_CO
This code is for unfolding a set of data from 2D measurements.


The unfolding function is used in this publication:

James, J., Payton, E., John, R., Jha, S., Arróyave, R. “Effect of Microtextured Region Stereology on Crack Growth Lifetime Predictions in Ti-6Al-4V” JOM (2022)


Cruz-Orive (CO) developed the algorithm in his paper:

L. Cruz Orive, “Particle Size-Shape Distributions: The General Spheroid Problem,” Journal of Microscopy, vol. 112, pp. 153–167, Mar. 1978.
